# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning for Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner

**I was solving this case study on Fiddle without data cleaning at first, but I couldn't continue with that messed-up data. So I finally switched to MySQL to re-prepare the data.**

Let's start with **runner_orders**. The table has:
- use of null as 'string'
- empty fields
- km/min/minutes in the distance and duration columns which will obstruct the analysis.

To clean the data, I created a new table called **runner_orders_new**, which is a copy of runner orders, so that no original data was lost.
